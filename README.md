# RB4-to-RB2
![RB4toRB2](./dependencies/header.png)


Welcome to the RB4 to RB2 repo.

DO NOT USE ONYX ON THESE FOR ANYTHING UNLESS YOU ARE CONVERTING TO PS3. THEY WILL WORK ON RB3/RB2/RB1.
Instructions on how to convert properly with Onyx are in the Onyx.txt file.

Instructions on how to pull properly are in the instructions.txt file.


@@Every song has been converted either through two methods, auto generation and hand conversions (Hand conversions are still a work in progress, and don't have all songs available.)
Auto generated conversions use Onyx, and are just that. Automatically converted. They do not carry the real venue events or lipsyncing.
Hand conversions are converts done by hand, and have all the proper meta data/lipsync/venue/and details from the real RB4 package.@@

Below is an extensive list of everything thats been hand converted:

## Disc Songs Completed (65/65):
All Rock Band 4 disc songs are playable.
