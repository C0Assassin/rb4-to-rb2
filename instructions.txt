Instructions on how to pull properly.

Use GitHub desktop, it is by far the easiest method and it allows you to just click one button and get all the necessary
DLC/updates straight to you with no hassle.

It will ask you to sign up to Github and sign in to the program, be sure to do that.

When you're done with all that, hit the File tab on the top left and click the clone a repository button.
A window will popup, with 3 tabs. Hit the URL tab.

Insert this url: https://github.com/C0Assassin/RB4-to-RB2
And be sure to choose ur local path; this is where it will constantly download updates to. I recommend making it where its
easily accessible and has a decent amount of storage space. 

Once done, it will clone the repo into ur local path directory. (This will take awhile with slow speeds)
On the top left current repository list, you should be able to click RB4-to-RB2, and ensure that your current branch is on the 
main branch.

You can pull updates that get sent by hitting the "Fetch Origin" button on the top of the program.
You can view the directory with "CTRL+SHIFT+F" or by hitting the middle "View in explorer" button in the center of the screen.

The CONs are individually sorted into large main folders like DISC songs, DLC-1, or DLC-2, etc. They are sorted as such so that they can be easily packed into a large CON pack either via Onyx or C3 Con Tools. (separate downloads)

For PS3 users or RPCS3 users, it is up to the end user (you), to convert these yourself for your own use. Use Onyx's "quick convert/pack" feature to convert these CONs into PKGs, that are useable in RPCS3/PS3.
